# xtal-slice

xtal-slice is a non-visual "view model" component similar to [xtal-tree](https://github.com/bahrus/xtal-tree).

Functionally it almost does what xtal-tree does, but in reverse.  xtal-tree takes a tree structure, and provides a "flattened" view of it that can be displayed via a virtual list component, like [xtal-vlist](https://github.com/bahrus/xtal-vlist).

xtal-slice, on the other hand, takes a flat list with many columns (typically), and groups the list by common column values.
